# Static

Static files for hxi2.fr, hosted on static.hxi2.fr.

I chose this design so that static files can potentially be stored on a CDN somewhere, or in a different server with more bandwidth.

Authentication cannot be done on this server, so the files are public.

For now, I will be using cloudflare workers assets serving for this, for as long as it's free.
